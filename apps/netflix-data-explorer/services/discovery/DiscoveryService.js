 * DiscoveryService interface to be implemented by subclasses.

 * Subclasses can provide environment specific implementations. For instance,
 * an implementation could poll a REST endpoint to discover the list of services
 * while another implementation could watch a local file for changes.
 *
 * Once the clusters are set, the service will emit a 'loaded' event that subscribers
 * can listen to for updates. Implementors are free to implement their own polling
 * interval or push/pull strategy.
 *
 * @event loaded-clusters When clusters have been loaded successfully.
 * @event loaded-environments When the list of environments have been loaded successfully.
 * @event loaded-regions When the list of regions have been loaded successfully.
 * @event error If an error was encountered while discovering.
